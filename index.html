<h1>web developers</h1>
<p>Hi, this is the github page for <a href="http://thecodingcompany.co.uk/" title="link to the coding company">the coding company</a> web developers based in Wiltshire UK and developing on a variety of different stacks.  Recent work has been on front end JS frameworks such as Angular using a custom built PHP API to take care of the data retrieval at the back end.  We also get involved in custom code for Wordpress including plugins and Woocommerce the e-commerce add-on.  Of course we still do the day to day regular coding with HTML, CSS and quite often jQuery.</p>
